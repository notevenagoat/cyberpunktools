<h3>Welcome Home Choom!</h3>
      Welcome to CyberpunkRED tools, this webapp is a growing collection of utilities for players and game masters of the TTPRG (Table Top Role Play Game) of Cyberpunk RED. (If you are not familiar with the game, and you are wondering “what is this?” ← click here.)

      <h3>Night Market Generator</h3>

Tired of looking for a fixer to source you that Subdermal Armor Implant? <br />

Create your own night market and get your players to spend those hard earned Eurobucks!. By default this app generates a market by RAW (Rules As Written), but we have given you some options to personalize the market. You can change the number of categories available in the market, as well as input a minimum number of items generated per category.

We have also added a total price calculator, in case greedy players wonder if it is worth the trouble (or the lead).

To generate a Market just use the number scroll on any of the inputs!.

<h3>Fashion Generator</h3>

Don’t know what to wear? Problem solved. Never be out of fashion in Night city!.<br />

If you or your players own an AGENT, by RAW (Rules As Written) it can give you a +2 Wardrobe and Style bonus “If you wear the clothes your agent suggests”...  This simple generator creates a list of what is ‘on fashion’ during that session. 

In our homebrew, you only have to wear 6 out of all the pieces to get the +2 bonus, and if you only wear 3 of them, you still get a +1. We like to extend that bonus to any skill that involves social interaction, but that is up to the GM to incorporate.

Combat Simulator (upcoming)

Want to know what percentage of headshotting that cyberpsycho is running toward from across the road? Did you miss your shot and want to know your percentage of surviving as he takes out his Wolvers and attempts to decapitate you? We got you covered.
